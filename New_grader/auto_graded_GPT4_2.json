For simplicity, let's consider the case where \\(Z = 3\\). When we sequentially interchange the first and second, and then the second and third electrons, we should get back to the original wavefunction, which demands:\n\n\\[-\\psi (r_1, r_2, r_3) = -[\\psi (r_2, r_1, r_3)] = -[-\\psi (r_2, r_3, r_1)] = \\psi (r_2, r_3, r_1) = \\psi (r_1, r_2, r_3)\\]\n\nThis is evidently possible. But if we consider that each individual interchange changes the sign of the wavefunction, this poses a problem when we apply the operation twice like we did:\n\n\\[-\\psi (r_1, r_2, r_3) = -[\\psi (r_2, r_1, r_3)] = \\psi (r_2, r_3, r_1)\\]\n\nThis shows that the wavefunction being completely symmetric and completely antisymmetric at the same time is contradictory. Hence, for \\(Z > 2\\) a completely antisymmetric (spin) state is impossible because it does not satisfy the required antisymmetry of the fermionic wavefunction under particle interchange, due to the constraints imposed by Pauli Exclusion Principle.

The correct expression for the energy estimate is obtained by adding the expectation values of the kinetic and potential energy terms and then finding the minimum with respect to 'a'. The correct comparison with the exact value of the first excited state energy for the SHO, which is (3/2)hbar*omega, would show that the trial function provides an upper bound to the first excited state energy."

The student also correctly states that the expectation value represents an upper bound for the energy of the first excited state according to the variational principle. However, the student did not complete the calculation of the expectation values for $\textlangle x^2 \textrangle$ and $\textlangle p^2 \textrangle$, which are necessary to determine the actual upper bound. The student also correctly states the exact value for the energy of the first excited state.
