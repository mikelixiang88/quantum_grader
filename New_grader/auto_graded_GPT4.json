The measurement at t1 doesn't change the state, it simply gives us information about the state; however, any given spin is now in a superposition of spin up and spin down along the x direction.\n\nThe key result you need here is that the |up_z> state is a superposition of |up_x> and |down_x> states. Specifically,\n\n$|up_z> = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} ( |up_x> + |down_x>)$\n\nFurthermore, the square of the amplitude gives the probability. Thus, prior to the first measurement, each spin has a $(1/\\sqrt{2})^2 = 1/2$ chance of being measured as |up_x>, and the same chance of being measured as |down_x>.\n\nWhen the second measurement is made at time t2, only the spins that give |up_x> are kept. Since the states |up_x> and |down_x> were equally likely at t1, this discard half the spins. Thus, the fraction of spins remaining that were spin up at t1 (either along z or x, whichever was measured) is 1/2.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that the spins measured along the z direction at t1 are still in the state |up_z>, regardless of the later measurement. So, for those spins that were measured along the z direction at t1, all of them were spin up. This is independent of the later measurement along the x axis at t2.\n\nIn summary, the final answer will depend on how many spins were measured along x or z at t1.
